I want to learn more about Android app development and I love helping others learn as well. Apparently, writing about Android will help me achieve both according to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus) Latin proverb. Every time I learn something new, I'll try my best to write about it. My posts include starter guides, skims or summaries of awesome resources I found online, or articles of any other format that I might develop in the future. Topics can be anything about Android app development!
